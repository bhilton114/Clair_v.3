# Clair V3.3

**Clair is a private cognitive AI prototype focused on governed reasoning, memory, verification, and self-correction.**

Clair is being developed as a solo-built, correction-first cognitive system. The core implementation is currently private while patent, licensing, and safety options are evaluated.

This public repository is used to share safe project summaries, benchmark-style results, development direction, and high-level design goals without exposing the internal source code or construction methods.

## Current Status

Clair V3.3 has reached the stage of a serious working prototype.

The system has demonstrated:

- Stable behavior under structured testing
- Controlled answer behavior
- Memory-centered reasoning experiments
- Verification and calibration workflows
- Document/context handling improvements
- Early tool-use and fallback routing
- GAIA-style benchmark stress testing
- Correction-first development discipline

Clair is not presented as finished or production-ready. Current work is focused on restoring and strengthening the core cognitive architecture before expanding capabilities further.

## Core Project Goal

Clair is intended to become a:

> Governed cognitive reasoner built around memory, reflection, verification, and moral constraint, designed to improve through interaction rather than static answering alone.

The long-term goal is not to build a simple chatbot or benchmark solver.

The goal is to build a system that can:

- Understand task shape
- Detect missing information
- Use memory responsibly
- Distinguish temporary context from durable memory
- Verify before trusting
- Recover from uncertainty
- Select tools by capability
- Reflect on failures
- Improve over time within moral and safety boundaries

## Design Philosophy

Clair is built around several core principles:

1. **Know what she does not know**
2. **Use memory carefully, not blindly**
3. **Prefer verification over confidence**
4. **Treat uncertainty as a signal to act, not a stopping point**
5. **Keep cognitive modules focused on one job**
6. **Correct mistakes instead of hiding them**
7. **Avoid benchmark-specific shortcuts**
8. **Preserve a governed moral code**

The project is being developed as a cognitive architecture first, not a neural-network-first system.

## Cognitive Direction

Clair’s intended reasoning pattern is:

```text
Input
 → Understand task
 → Detect missing needs
 → Check context
 → Retrieve relevant memory
 → Select capability
 → Use tools or fallbacks
 → Verify evidence
 → Apply governance
 → Answer or refuse
 → Reflect and learn
